Insertion Sorting - It is a simple and intuitive sorting methodology. Imagine you have a deck of cards that you want to sort in ascending order. To do this using insertion sort, you start with an empty hand and take one card from the deck. This first card is already considered sorted because it's the only card in your hand. Now, you pick another card from the deck and compare it to the card in your hand. If the new card is smaller, you insert it before the card in your hand. Otherwise, if the new card is larger, you place it after the card in your hand. This way, you're maintaining a sorted sequence of cards in your hand as you go. You continue picking cards from the deck one by one and inserting them into the sorted sequence in your hand. With each new card, you compare it to the cards in your hand and find its correct position in the sorted sequence. You shift the cards in your hand as necessary to make room for the new card and ensure the sequence remains sorted. You repeat this process until you've picked all the cards from the deck and inserted them into the sorted sequence in your hand. At the end, the cards in your hand will be sorted in ascending order.

Bubble sorting - it uses analogy of sorting elements from smallets to largest by comparing adjacent pairs. Imagine you have a box filled with numbered balls, and you want to arrange them in ascending order from smallest to largest. To do this using bubble sort in Python, you start by comparing adjacent pairs of balls and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The goal is to make the larger balls "bubble" up to the top of the box with each iteration. For the descending order, do the opposite of the process.
